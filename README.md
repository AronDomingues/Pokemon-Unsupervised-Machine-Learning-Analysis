# Unsupervised Machine Learning analysis regarding Pokémon!


## 📝INTRO

In this project, we explore the fascinating data of **Pokémon through the lens of unsupervised machine learning (UML).**

## 📝OBJECTIVE

By uncovering hidden patterns and insights from the Pokémon dataset without relying on predefined labels,
the **objective** of this analysis is to **group and rank Pokémon based on selected characteristics: HP, Attack, Defense, SP Attack, and SP Defense**.

To achieve this, we apply a variety of UML techniques including clustering, factor analysis, ranking, and correspondence analysis (CA).

## 📝METHODOLOGY

1) Factor analysis aids in reducing the dimensionality of the data, highlighting the key factors that drive Pokémon characteristics (HP, Attack, Defense, SP Attack, and SP Defense) into Factors.
2) Ranking provides a method to evaluate and prioritize Pokémon based on the defined Factors, offering a structured approach to assess their relative significance.
3) Clustering is utilized to group Pokémon into distinct clusters based on their similarities, enabling us to identify underlying patterns in their attributes.
4) Correspondence Analysis (CA) is employed to analyze and visualize the relationships between clusters and ranking scores , providing insights into the associations and patterns within the dataset.

By applying these techniques, we aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Pokémon data, reveal distinctive groupings, and uncover valuable relationships that could inform further research or applications in the Pokémon domain.

## 📝RESULTS
Factor analysis was conducted to reduce the number of variables, which allowed us to rank Pokémon based on the factors.
This reduction facilitated ranking and clustering Pokémons by their similarities.

# It was possible to see that cluster 4 has the best Pokémon according to defined parameters.
